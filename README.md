## What's this?

Killing The Bear 2.0, same as v1 but way more focused. On what? Only Russian threats.&#x20;

As you can see, there‚Äôs now a landing page at ‚Äúhttps://killingthebear.es‚Äù where actors and any updates (malware and campaigns coming soon) will be uploaded.

KTB 2.0 won‚Äôt be a repository of already known data. I won‚Äôt collect data that‚Äôs already perfectly organized and widely accessible like Mitre. This time the goal is to provide relevant, actionable information for blue teamers and adversary emulation from the red team‚Äôs perspective, ALWAYS following the style and premises of Russian adversaries.

KTB 2.0 is NOT an OSINT repository, it‚Äôs a repository for Purple Team, its not just for Intel, and it‚Äôll be built as such.&#x20;

It won‚Äôt only publish about widely known APTs or adversaries, it might also publish about more underground, loner adversaries that might not be as ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù for the masses but are interesting to the creator of KTB.

You can keep reach Killing The Bear 2.0 from [Github](https://github.com/Ud0g-Py/Killing-The-Bear) too.

## What happened to the previous version of KTB?

You can still access the old version of KTB through previous commits on the official [Github](https://github.com/Ud0g-Py/Killing-The-Bear) repository. There used to be many entries, but the vast majority were empty. Now there will be far fewer entries, but with much more valuable content focused exclusively on adversary emulation bit a bit.

## KTB & AI

Lens is activated in this repository. That means you‚Äôll be able to search and relate information using Lens‚Äô AI. This is a feature of Gitbook and therefore may be subject to change.

You only have to click in the upper search panel, and click in the "lens" button at the right. That's all, let the magic do all for you.

## Nomenclature & Aliases

Yes, KTB 2.0 will have its own nomenclature for actors.&#x20;

The main identifier will be its own and the different community names will be categorized as ‚Äúaliases‚Äù. This will allow you to access, for example, ‚ÄúSyndicate-85‚Äù by searching for ‚ÄúAPT28‚Äù and similar. Why do I do it this way? Because I don‚Äôt always agree with the attributions of different manufacturers and why not, because I usually don‚Äôt like the names of big companies ;P.
