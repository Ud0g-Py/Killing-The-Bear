RockPort is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013 primarily targeting the U.S. [retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors, often using point-of-sale malware](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/). [This organized group, known as the Carbanak threat actor, specializes in banking fraud and stealing credit card information using point-of-sale malware](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/). It also compromised ATMs and used malicious scripts on them to get money. [The group is known for being technically advanced and highly effective](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/).

[To compromise systems,](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/)[ uses a variety of methods, such as running phishing campaigns via email or exploiting common vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon/ProxyShell to penetrate targeted infrastructures](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/). [It might also buy stolen credentials in the underground markets, which it tests with tools it developed before using it to access targets’ environments](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/). RockPort[ also makes use of the BadUSB attack, which consists of USB sticks with active payloads simulating a keyboard and being run as soon as the USB device is connected to a computer](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/).

[Since 2020 shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/). To operate ransomware, RockPort chooses its target according to public information about companies and their revenues. It aims for companies with high revenue, which might pay ransom quicker than smaller ones. [The target’s revenue is also used to calculate the ransom value](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fin7-threat-actor-ransomware/).
