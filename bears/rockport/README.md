RockPort is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013 primarily targeting the U.S. retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors, often using point-of-sale malware. This organized group, known as the Carbanak threat actor, specializes in banking fraud and stealing credit card information using point-of-sale malware. It also compromised ATMs and used malicious scripts on them to get money. The group is known for being technically advanced and highly effective.

To compromise systems, uses a variety of methods, such as running phishing campaigns via email or exploiting common vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon/ProxyShell to penetrate targeted infrastructures. It might also buy stolen credentials in the underground markets, which it tests with tools it developed before using it to access targets’ environments. RockPort also makes use of the BadUSB attack, which consists of USB sticks with active payloads simulating a keyboard and being run as soon as the USB device is connected to a computer.

Since 2020 shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. To operate ransomware, RockPort chooses its target according to public information about companies and their revenues. It aims for companies with high revenue, which might pay ransom quicker than smaller ones. The target’s revenue is also used to calculate the ransom value.
