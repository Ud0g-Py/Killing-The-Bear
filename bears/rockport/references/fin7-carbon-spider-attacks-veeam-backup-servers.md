# FIN7/Carbon Spider Attacks Veeam Backup Servers

Researchers at WithSecure cybersecurity firm have seen two malware attacks against **Veeam Backup and Replication** servers believed to be initiated by cybercrime group FIN7, also known as**Carbon Spider**, which has also been linked to **Darkside**,**BlackMatter**, and **BlackCat**/**ALPHV**

ransomware variants.

The [WithSecure](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/fin7-target-veeam-servers) investigators believe that the attacks may be part of a larger campaign, but that the scope of the attack is limited. Nonetheless, because of the sophistication of FIN7, WithSecure recommends that companies using

**Veeam**’s solutions follow Veeam’s recommendations and guidelines to patch and configure their backup servers against a recently discovered vulnerability as outlined in [Kb4424:**CVE-2023-27532**](https://www.veeam.com/kb4424)and watch for signs of compromise.
