# OSINT ChatGPT Query of the the Day (QoD) - APT 29

Created a prompt to extract info about the evolution of APT 29&#x20;

Output/Report below:

APT29, also known as

**Cozy Bear**, The Dukes, or**Nobelium**

, is a sophisticated cyber-espionage group linked to the Russian government. They have been active since at least 2008 and are known for their persistent and advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Over the years, APT29 has evolved in response to various factors, such as technological advancements, geopolitical developments, and changes in their targets. Here's a timeline of the evolution of APT29's TTPs and notable incidents:

1. 2008-2012: Early Operations

* Initial attacks focused on cyber-espionage targeting government and military organizations, primarily in Eastern Europe and the United States.

Primary TTPs: Spear-phishing emails, social engineering, and custom malware (e.g.,**MiniDuke**and**CosmicDuke**

* ).

2. 2014: Major Shift in Targets and Methods

* APT29 expanded its targeting to include political, think tank, and diplomatic organizations worldwide.
* Significant change in TTPs: Emphasis on stealth and persistence, using modular malware (e.g.,**Hammertoss**
* ) and innovative data exfiltration techniques, like hiding data in images (steganography).

3. 2016: US Election Interference

* APT29, along with APT28 (**Fancy Bear**
* ), was accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leaking confidential documents to influence the US presidential election.
* This incident raised the group's profile and highlighted the geopolitical motivations behind their activities.

4. 2017-2018: Expansion and Adaptation

* APT29 further diversified its targets, attacking critical infrastructure,
*
  * TTPs evolved to include supply chain attacks, leveraging third-party software and hardware to compromise victims.

Notable incidents: 2017**NotPetya**

* ransomware attack, which disrupted businesses globally; 2018 attack on the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics infrastructure.

5. 2019-2020: COVID-19 Pandemic Response

* APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and public health organizations, aiming to steal intellectual property and sensitive data.
* TTPs continued to involve spear-phishing, but also included password spraying and exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities.
* Notable incidents: The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and US government agencies attributed cyberattacks on COVID-19 vaccine research centers to APT29.

6. 2021: SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack

* APT29 executed one of the largest and most significant supply chain attacks in history, compromising SolarWinds' Orion software update system.
* This attack affected thousands of organizations globally, including US government agencies and private companies.
* TTPs involved a highly sophisticated multi-stage attack that leveraged compromised software updates to deploy custom malware (e.g.,**Sunburst**

and**Teardrop**

*
  * ).
* In conclusion, APT29 has demonstrated an ability to evolve its TTPs over time, reacting to changes in technology, geopolitics, and target opportunities. The group has successfully executed high-profile cyber-espionage campaigns and demonstrated a willingness to engage in disruptive cyber activities, reflecting the objectives and interests of the Russian government. Organizations should remain vigilant and implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect against advanced threat actors like APT29.

Below is a table outlining the most common TTPs employed by APT29 over the years:

| Year      | Most Common TTPs                                                                           |
