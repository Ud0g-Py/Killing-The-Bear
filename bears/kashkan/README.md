Kashkan is known for conducting watering hole and spearphishing campaigns and leveraging in-house tools and malware. Their espionage platform is mainly used against Windows machines but has also been seen used against macOS and Linux machines. The group has been seen to have heightened activity in mid-2015.

In October 2019 it was revealed that Kashkan had compromised another threat actor believed to be Iran that targets private-sector and government entities for the purpose of espionage. Some operations previously attributed to the group may be Kashkan false flags.
