# Targeted Attacks by Turla (UAC-0024, UAC-0003) Using CAPIBAR and KAZUAR Malware (CERT-UA#6981)

The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) is taking measures to counter cyber threats. Since 2022, activity has been tracked under the identifier UAC-0024 that consists of carrying out targeted cyberattacks against the defense forces with the aim of spying using the CAPIBAR malware (Microsoft: "DeliveryCheck", Mandiant: "GAMEDAY").

In addition to using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and COM-hijacking, the CAPIBAR malware is characterized by the presence of a server component that is usually installed on compromised MS Exchange servers as a MOF (Managed Object Format) file using the PowerShell-based Desired State Configuration (DCS) tool, effectively turning a legitimate server into a malware control center.

At the stage of initial compromise, in addition to sending emails with an attachment in the form of a macro-enabled document, attackers can modify documents (for example, on an internal public network resource), adding several lines of code to the structure of the legitimate macro that will enable the execution of PowerShell.

Under certain circumstances, a complex, multi-functional KAZUAR backdoor is loaded onto the affected computers. The backdoor has more than 40 functions, including:

* "chakra" (launching JS using ChakraCore)
* "eventlog" (obtaining data from OS logs)
* "forensic" (collecting artifacts: compatibilityassistant, exploreruserassist, activitiescache, prefetchfiles, muicache)
* "steal" (stealing authentication data: passwords, bookmarks, autofill, history, proxies, cookies, filezilla, chromium, mozilla, outlook, openvpn, system, winscp, signal, git)
* "unattend" (stealing databases/configuration files of programs: KeePass, Azure, Gcloud, AWS, bluemix, etc.)

Among other things, there have been known cases of file exfiltration from infected computers with a defined list of extensions using the legitimate rclone program.

Taking into account the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as the fact that the KAZUAR program is used, the described activity (UAC-0024) is associated with the Turla group (UAC-0003, KRYPTON, Secret Blizzard), whose activities are directed by the FSB of Russia.

In order to create favorable conditions for detecting the threat, samples of the malware have been distributed to companies developing security products.
